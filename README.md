# HASSVoiceInterface-TGIF

A collection of snippets, samples, starters and lessons learned from the [legendary Friday's Party Home Assistant thread by NathanCu](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/fridays-party-creating-a-private-agentic-ai-using-voice-assistant-tools/855862)

Contents:

- Initial summary of the thread in the Community forum, tablesetting
- code snippets and examples will be refactored out into their own individual atomic blocks as markdown files containing code blocks for !inclusion in other documents or notes
- reference material useful in the pursuit of advancing speech interfaces into HomeAssistant and beyond
- exported chats from troubleshooting with an AI co-pilot
- documentation that supplements everything else here


## Assumptions

Most of what is here will be very specific for implementing speech and voice interfaces into HomeAssistant, and typically using HomeAssistant's button in their App, a [[VoicePE Puck]], or other device.
