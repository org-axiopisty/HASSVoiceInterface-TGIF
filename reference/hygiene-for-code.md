- Code blocks should indicate lang; e.g. `yaml` or `python` or `golang` etc.
- Never submit a PR or contribute anything that contains an API key or other secret
- If you see a functional secret in any code or documentation in this repo, please open an issue immediately and put `[credential leak]` in the issue name, please, it will literally set off an alarm at my house. Don't be why I can't have nice things.

Specifying language in a code block is straightforward in markdown, here's some examples.

e.g. 
 ```yaml
use spaces
  not tabs
    when writing yaml
 ```

```python
same as python
  spaces, not tabs
  it's not your chrome window
	  it's AI's native language
```
