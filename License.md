Licensing for the contents of this repository is not locked in, so if you have an opinion, speak up. To not be blocked I selected MIT for the repo, and here's why: 

> [!question] License
> I have chose the MIT license mainly to ensure that people retain acknowledgements for their work but don't put requirements on people that just want to get an in-house Speech Interface to AI integrated with their household, not ship products. If you have a concern, open an issue and tell us what you're concerned about, I don't have a strong feeling on license for this project other than to ensure people that have contributed should have their names on this because a lot of this is some of the first publicly available functional examples of voice AI interfaces in an accessible format.
